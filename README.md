📄 Description:
Personal Finance Tracker is a full-featured web-based application built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js), designed to help individual users efficiently manage their personal finances in a secure, intuitive, and visually engaging manner.
The platform allows users to register and log in securely, track their income and expenses, set monthly budgets, monitor transaction history, export financial reports as Excel or PDF, and gain visual insights via charts. The system ensures data isolation, meaning each user’s financial data is private and accessible only to them.
It also includes a personalized profile section where users can upload their photo and securely reset their password via email.
